      <p>Whether you're running a 3D printing business or just want to track your hobby expenses, calculating the true cost of 3D printing is essential. While many people only consider the cost of filament, there are several other factors that contribute to the total cost of a print.</p>

      <h2>The Main Components of 3D Printing Costs</h2>

      <h3>1. Material Costs</h3>
      <p>This is the most obvious cost - the filament used in your print. To calculate this accurately:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find the weight of your print (in grams)</li>
        <li>Determine the cost of your filament per gram (filament price ÷ 1000)</li>
        <li>Multiply the weight by the cost per gram</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Print weight (g) × Filament cost ($/g)</p>

      <h3>2. Electricity Costs</h3>
      <p>Your 3D printer consumes electricity, which adds to the total cost:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Determine your printer's power consumption (in watts)</li>
        <li>Calculate the energy used in kilowatt-hours (print time × wattage ÷ 1000)</li>
        <li>Multiply by your electricity rate ($/kWh)</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Print time (hours) × Printer wattage (W) ÷ 1000 × Electricity rate ($/kWh)</p>

      <h3>3. Labor Costs</h3>
      <p>If you're selling prints or running a business, factor in your time:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Estimate the time spent on setting up the print</li>
        <li>Include post-processing time</li>
        <li>Assign an hourly rate for your labor</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Total time spent (hours) × Hourly rate ($)</p>

      <h3>4. Printer Depreciation</h3>
      <p>Your printer has a limited lifespan and will eventually need replacement:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Estimate your printer's lifespan (in printing hours)</li>
        <li>Divide the printer cost by its lifespan</li>
        <li>Multiply by the hours of the print</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Formula:</strong> (Printer cost ÷ Estimated lifespan hours) × Print time (hours)</p>

      <h3>5. Failed Print Costs</h3>
      <p>Not every print succeeds. Account for failures:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Estimate your failure rate (percentage)</li>
        <li>Add this percentage to your total cost</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Formula:</strong> Base cost × (1 + Failure rate)</p>

      <h2>Using Our 3D Print Cost Calculator</h2>
      <p>Our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">3D Print Cost Calculator</a> makes it easy to factor in all these costs with just a few inputs. Simply enter:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your filament type and cost</li>
        <li>Estimated print weight</li>
        <li>Print time</li>
        <li>Electricity cost and printer wattage</li>
        <li>Failure rate and labor costs</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The calculator will instantly provide you with a detailed breakdown of all costs associated with your print.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Accurately calculating your 3D printing costs is crucial for pricing your services fairly or understanding your hobby expenses. By considering all the factors above, you'll have a much more realistic view of how much each print truly costs.</p>
